# Genetics-Code-Quiz
## Motivation
As a former middle school science teacher, I wanted to test use my JavaScript abilities to create a review game for students for Genetics unit. With dynamically created HTML elements, questions and answer choices appear after the correct answer is chosen. As a motivator for students, the timer component was included and subtracts 5 seconds for each incorrect answer. If all questions are answered, the score is taken according to the time left on the timer and stored in Local Storage, if higher than previous score.

## The Task
Provided by University of Denver Coding BootCamp:
```
As you proceed in your journey to becoming a full-stack web developer, it’s likely that you’ll be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

To help you become familiar with these tests and give you a chance to apply the skills from this module, this week’s homework invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. This week’s coursework will teach you all the skills you need to succeed in this assignment.
